## Using FEV to assess and communicate flood-mitigation schemes

This organization comprises a compilation of case studies to demonstrate the use of FEV in flood-mitigation assessment. FEV allows one to analyse and quantify the magnitude of river floods using (often publically-available) data, and then to assess the (cost-)effectiveness of potential and actual flood-mitigation schemes. The output of this process is a graphical tool that (i) contextualises the magnitude of the flood relative to the river valley and (ii) facilitates quick and direct assessment of the contribution and value of various mitigation measures.

In summary, FEV offers:
* a complementary way of classifying flood events;
* a protocol to optimise assessment of mitigation scenarios, including cost-effectiveness analyses, for the benefit of policy makers and the public;
* evidence-based decision-making for flood-mitigation schemes.

Note that this analysis does not replace the need for performing detailed hydrodynamic modelling and should be used either prior to or in tandem with the modelling. It does, however, as an important practical alternative, replace such calculations in cases where either insufficient computational resources are available or a quick and accessible assessment is required.

## Case studies
A caase study comprises a river flood of interest (historical or simulated) and a suite of potential flood-mitigation schemes (actual or hypothetical).
Each case study has its own repository which contains the relevant source code and documentation to run the analysis, as well as an example of the output. If the case study has featured in published work, then links and references are provided. 

Programming/software: currently, there are examples in Python, R, Matlab, and Excel. See each case study for more info.

**If anyone would like to contribute a full case study, or provide data and mitigation plans from a river flood of interest so that the analysis can be carried out, please contact the contributors.**
