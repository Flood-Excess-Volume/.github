## Using FEV to assess and communicate flood-mitigation schemes: case studies 

This organization comprises a compilation of river flood case studies to demonstrate the use of FEV to assess the (cost-) effectiveness of potential and actual flood-mitigation schemes. FEV allows one to analyse river floods using (often publically-available) data and is central to a new cost-effectiveness protocol for flood-mitigation plans. 

Each case study (i.e., river flood) has its own repository which contains the relevant source code and documentation to run the analysis, as well as an example of the output. If the case study has featured in published work, then links and references are provided. 

Programming/software: currently, there are examples in Python, R, Matlab, and Excel. 

**If anyone would like to contribute a full case study, or provide data and mitigation plans from a river flood of interest, please contact the contributors.**
